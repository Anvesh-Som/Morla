# Morla

## Inspiration
Morla is an autonomous differential drive robot inspired from the popular robotics platform, turtlebot. While turtlebot being a fairly robust robotic platform, not everyone can afford it, hence morla is designed to be a plug, play & tweak platform to run most of the popular algorithms related to robot control, perception and navigation, while being cheaper than it's original inspiration.


Its main processing unit is a Raspberry Pi 4 B running Ubuntu 18.04 and the ROS 1 (ROS Melodic) middleware, while containing variety of sensors ranging from LIDAR to inertial and visual sensors, to serve as a true learning platform. This respository contains ROS driver packages, ROS Control Hardware Interface for the real robot and configurations for simulating Morla.
